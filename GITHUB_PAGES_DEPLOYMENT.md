# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Deploy to GitHub Pages

Your project is now configured for GitHub Pages deployment. Here's how to deploy:

### 1. Push Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure for GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. The deployment will start automatically when you push to main/master branch

### 3. Check Deployment Status

- Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
- You should see the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow running
- Wait for it to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)

### 4. Access Your Site

Your site will be available at: `https://[your-username].github.io/Zifr.one/`

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. Router Configuration

- Changed from `BrowserRouter` to `HashRouter` for GitHub Pages compatibility
- This prevents 404 errors on page refresh

### 2. Base Path Configuration

- Updated Vite config to use correct base path for GitHub Pages
- Set to `/Zifr.one/` in production

### 3. SPA Redirect Scripts

- Added 404.html for handling direct URL access
- Added redirect script in index.html for proper routing

### 4. GitHub Actions Workflow

- Updated deployment workflow to use correct build command
- Added proper environment variables

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you still see a blank page:

1. **Check the URL**: Make sure you're using the correct GitHub Pages URL
2. **Clear browser cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
3. **Check browser console**: Look for any JavaScript errors
4. **Verify deployment**: Check the Actions tab for build success

### Common Issues:

1. **404 Errors**: The HashRouter should fix this
2. **Assets not loading**: Check if the base path is correct
3. **Build failures**: Check the Actions tab for error logs

## 📝 Environment Variables

For GitHub Pages, you don't need to set environment variables in the UI since they're handled in the build process. However, if you need to add any, you can:

1. Go to repository **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Add any required environment variables

## 🔄 Updating Your Site

To update your deployed site:

1. Make your changes
2. Commit and push to main/master branch
3. GitHub Actions will automatically rebuild and deploy

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the Actions tab for build logs
2. Verify all files are committed and pushed
3. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings

Your site should now work perfectly on GitHub Pages! 🎉
